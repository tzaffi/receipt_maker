Hi **FRIEND**,

Thank you for today's great lesson!

Would you mind going to the following link and filling out a receipt for the hours which you spent 
**TUTORING JONBOY**? 

If you use a desktop web browser an image will be generated which you can just save to your desktop
and email me as an attachment. 

Unfortunately, the form has no database so I can't see the receipt unless you email it directly to me
right after generating it. That means that if you are working on your desktop/laptop computer you have to drag 
the generated image to your desktop and then email it back to me as an attachment.

If you are on your phone, it's a little more complicated because you have to take a screenshot first and "share" 
the generated photo by email.

All the best,

**ME MYSELF AND I**
