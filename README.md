# receipt_maker
Make receipts with signatures and save them.

This is based on [szimek's Signature Pad](https://github.com/szimek/signature_pad)

## GOAL: Allow easy creation of gigster receipts with signatures.

E.g. your child's tutor comes, you pay them $60, then they sign a receipt attesting to the fact
that you paid them $60 which you can save for your records.
